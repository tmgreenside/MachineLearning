# Machine Learning
This repository is for my own review of machine learning concepts I
came across in an REU internship. I'm refreshing on what I learned and
attempting projects to expand my knowledge base.

### Regression
Implementation of linear regression. Logistic regression will be attempted
later.

### GAN
My attempt at a Generative Adversarial Network. I worked with one of these in
my internship, and I want to actually implement my own rather than modify one
that was made for me.
